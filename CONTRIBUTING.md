# Contributing to Ivann

First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

Ivann is currently maintained by seven
[Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) students.
We will work hard to keep Ivann alive and will try to address
issues and PRs as quickly as we can.

## How can I contribute?

#### Bug reporting

If using ivann you have found a bug, or something else that you expected
to behave otherwise, please
[create an issue](https://github.com/icivann/ivann/issues/new). 
Please describe in as much detail as you can the behaviour you came
across, and the behaviour you expected instead.

#### Feature suggestions

If you have an idea of something that is within the scope of what ivann
tries to achieve, we would be happy to hear about it. To let us know
please [create an issue](https://github.com/icivann/ivann/issues/new)
describing your idea in detail.

If we agree that it would bring value, we will develop it when we can.
Alternatively you can [make a pull request](#making-a-pr) where you
implement your idea yourself, and we will be happy to review it.

#### Making a PR

In order to get a bug fixed or bring a new feature, you can start your own
pull request. If you've never done this, you can find some info 
[here](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions#first-contributions).
